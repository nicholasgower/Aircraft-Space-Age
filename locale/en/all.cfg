advanced-aerodynamics=Further research into high-speed aerodynamics.
gunships=Combat and cargo aircraft, the standard aircraft which all others are branched off of.
jets=For when you need to get somewhere FAST, comes with a rapid-fire machine gun, homing missile launcher, and a napalm launcher. Yeah, you betcha that napalm hurts.
cargo-planes=A long-range flying chest, comes equipped with a weak machine gun, and no equipment grid, but has an enormous cargo capacity.
flying-fortress=The ultimate in aerial superiority, comes with a tank cannon (Yes, you read that right), a high round-per-minute machine gun, a homing missile launcher, and a huge equipment grid!
high-explosive-cannon-shells=10x (theoretically) stronger explosive shells, for when dead isn't good enough.
afterburner=Push your aircraft to the speed limit with an afterburner!
aircraft-energy-shield=Lightweight, high-capacity shield modules designed for heavy fire.
napalm=A longer-burning alternative to flamethrower fuel, works especially well when fired from vehicle-mounted launchers!
gunships-carbon-fiber=Lightweight alternative to conventional gunships. Weighs half as much and consumes half as much fuel.
jets-carbon-fiber=Lightweight alternative to conventional jets. Weighs half as much and consumes half as much fuel.
cargo-planes-carbon-fiber=Lightweight alternative to conventional cargo planes. Weighs half as much and consumes half as much fuel.
flying-fortress-carbon-fiber=Lightweight alternative to the conventional flying fortress. Weighs half as much and consumes half as much fuel.
